# Devlog Entry - 11/19/23

## Intoducing the Team
### Tools lead - Aaron Lee
### Engine lead - Jonathan Alvarez
### Design lead - Gyle Viloria
### Assistant - Wichapas Pichetpongsa
### Backup - Nhan Nguyen

## Tools and Materials
### - We decided to use Phaser framework for now (might change in the future). We chose Phaser because we all had past experience of using this framework and we thought it might be suiting for a 2D grid game.
### - We decided to use either Typescript or Javascript because we can use what was taught in class and everyone in the group would have similar familiarity with the language.
### - We most likely will be using VSCode for our IDE. This is due to our familiarity with the IDE and everybody is on the same page.

## Outlook
### - The hardest/riskiest part of the project is how we chose Phaser but if we don't feel like it fits the requirements we might have to change the framework in the future.
