## Tools and Materials

### - For our engine, we decided to use Phaser 3 because it is an engine that every member is familiar with and it uses js/ts. With the game being grid-based, it would seem easy to use Phaser 3 to keep things simple skipping the need of using an engine that supports 3d graphics. CMPM 120 was everyone's first run-in with Phaser and after having used it back then + our newfound knowledge of js/ts it only seemed natural that we would use Phaser. Since the team has a decent level of familiarity with Phaser we thought this was the best plan to be able to adapt to any assignment requirements added throughout the project

### - We decided to use either Typescript or Javascript because we can use what was taught in class and everyone in the group would have similar familiarity with the language. Also, Typescript having "interface" is something we feel like might come in handy.

### - We most likely will be using VSCode for our IDE. This is due to our familiarity with the IDE and everybody is on the same page

## Outlook

### - The hardest/riskiest part of the project is how we chose Phaser but if we don't feel like it fits the requirements we might have to change the framework in the future
